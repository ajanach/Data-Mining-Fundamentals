# Data Mining Fundamentals

## Intro
In this GitHub repository, you will find R language code for various data analysis techniques, including aggregation, nearest neighbor classification, random forest, association rule learning, and k-means clustering. Additionally, you will find a .csv file containing the data set used for analysis. This repository was created as part of the final project for the "Deep Data Analysis" course at the Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies.

## About Analysis:
This analysis focuses on a data set from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases. [(URL)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/predict-diabities) The data set was obtained from "kaggle.com". The goal of this data set is to diagnose whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the data set. This data set contains several variables, some of which are independent (more medical variables for prediction) and only one dependent target variable (Outcome).

The described data set contains data from 768 individuals and analyzes 9 different variables. The variables contain information about pregnancies, blood sugar concentration, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin reaction, Body Mass Index, diabetes function in pedigree, age, and outcome. The data set was originally obtained from the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the goal of this data set is to diagnose whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the data set.

| Columns | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Pregnancies | To express the Number of pregnancies |
| Glucose | To express the Glucose level in blood |
| BloodPressure | To express the Blood pressure measurement |
| SkinThickness | To express the thickness of the skin |
| Insulin | To express the Insulin level in blood |
| BMI | To express the Body mass index |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | To express the Diabetes percentage |
| Age | To express the age |
| Outcome | To express the final result 1 is Yes and 0 is No |

In addition, it has been noted that there are some limitations in the selection of these examples from a larger database. Specifically, all patients in this data set are women, at least 21 years old, and belong to the Pima Indian tribe.

From this data set in the .csv file, we can find several variables, some of which are independent (more medical predictive variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).
